Website developed for "Inmobiliaria ZÃºniga y Asoc." a real state agency, with the integration of analytics, cookies (for storing the user preferences) and politics. 
I implement tools from firebase like: hosting, storage and firestore database. I buil-in an appointment scheduling tool and a tool for making quotes. The quotes tool allow the user to know which projects and properties is able to buy just by entering his avarage salary.

As my first big project for a company I focused on improving the loading time and SEO. I optimized the code as much as I could and I also minified every document for improving performance.
